Notes :
1.IF the link Id is not found on both the Server A and Server B, then nothing is
sent to Server C and thus server C doesn't print anything.
2. If Link Id is found at Server A, there is no need to check for the Link Id on
 Server B
3. If Link Id is not found on Server A and Server B, there is no need to do
calculation and hence no information needs to be sent to Server C and thus in
this case, Aws doesn't print any message related to Server C and simply sends No
Match to both client and monitor.
